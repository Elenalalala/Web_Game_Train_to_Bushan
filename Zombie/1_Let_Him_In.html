            <p>Shawn climbs up to the window so that the zombies can not catch him. </p>
            <p>You open the window to let him in, but you soon notice that there is a scratch on his arm.</p>
            <p>You are scared that he is hurt by a zombie. </p>
            <p> Shawn explains, “I fell down and it was just a scratch.” </p>
            <p>Every one believes him for now, but you see him secretly cover his other arm as if he wants to cover something up.</p>
            <p>It still happens.</p>
            <p>Shawn goes crazy and wants to bite Kitty.</p>
            <p>You fight with Shawn to protect your daughter.</p>
            <p>In the fight, Shawn bites you in the shoulder, but you are able to lock Shawn in a small room.</p>
            <p>You know death will come to you soon, but you want your daughter to live.</p>
            <p>You ask Tracy to take your daughter away. Kitty would not leave you.</p>

            <p class="option" ><a href="1_BiteD_END.html">Wait till your daughter leaves.</a></p>
