            <p>Hundreds of zombies block every window and door.</p>
            <p> You could not get out and they could not get inside.</p>
            <p>You are currently safe, but out of food and water. You don't know where Kitty is.</p>
            <p>However, you are hopeful that the police will eventually rescue you and her.</p>
