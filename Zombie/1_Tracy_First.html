            <p>Your first reaction is to save Tracy who is closer to you.</p>
            <p>There is no time to save another person.</p>
            <p> Unfortunately, Shawn can not make it to the top and is swallowed in the zombies’ crowd.</p>
            <p>Tracy is struggling with climbing up and a zombie almost gets her. You raid the zombie’s head to help Tracy and pull her up.</p>
            <p>However, it was too late, the zombie had already bitten on her leg. Tracy looks at her wound, terrified.</p>
            <p>A sudden and strong pain spread throughout her body, she screams, “AHHHH!!!”“Help me! My baby is coming."</p>
            <p>You help deliver Tracy’s child. After an hour, her child is born. </p>
            <p>Tracy asks you to keep her baby safe. She knows death is waiting for her.</p>

            <p class="options">You are moved by Tracy and promise to keep her baby alive. </p>
