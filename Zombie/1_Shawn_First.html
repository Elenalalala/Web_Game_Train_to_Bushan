            <h1>Train to Bushan</h1>
            <div id="train"><img src="train1.png"></div>
            <p>Your first reaction is to save Tracy who is closer to you.</p>
            <p>After you successfully save Shawn, you see Tracy struggling with climbing up and a zombie almost gets her.</p>
            <p>You raid the zombie’s head to help Tracy and pull her up.</p>
            <p>However, it was too late, the zombie had already bitten on her leg. Tracy looks at her wound, terrified.</p>
            <p>Shawn notices her wound and shouts with terror, “she is infected!”</p>
            <p>A sudden and strong pain spread throughout her body, she screams, “AHHHH!!!”“Help me! My baby is coming."</p>
            <p>Shawn standby without knowing what to do while you help deliver Tracy’s child. </p>                
            <p>After an hour, her child is born. </p>
            <p>Shawn is terrified and insists to kill Tracy and her child, “She is infected. So is her child!!! We have to kill them before they kill us!”</p>
            <p>Shawn robs Tracy’s child over your hands and he is going to throw the child down to the zombie crowd. </p>
            <p>“NOOOO,” Tracy screams and runs to her child in her feeble body.</p>
            <p>In the fighting of the child, Tracy and Shawn both fall off the edge with the poor newborn. </p>
            <p>You were not able to save any of them. </p>
            <p>Hearing the roar of the zombies, you and your daughter are desperate, waiting for rescue.</p>
