            <div id="train"><img src="train1.png"></div>
            <p>There is no time to mourn. Lots of zombies are running to you.</p>
            <p>You entered the train station, but a big gas explosion blasts the entire building up. The floor collapses. </p>
            <p> Luckily, ohters are still alive. Tracy and Shawn are hanging at the bottom. Zombies are just nearby, sprinting towards Shawn.</p>
            <p>Shawn cries out for your help. Tracy is closer to you and rather safer than Shawn, but having trouble climbing up because she is pregnant. </p>
            <p>“Help me please! They're gonna get me! ” Shawn reaches out his shaky hand to you. </p>
            <p>Zombies are coming fast, you have to make a decision. </p>
            <p class="option"><a href="0_Tracy_First.html">Save Tracy first.</a></p>
            <p class="option"><a href="0_Shawn_First.html">Save Shawn first.</a></p>
