            <p>You hold the door and wait for them to get in.</p>
            <p>Fortunately he zombies don't have intelligence so they can't open the door.</p>
            <p> You are safe for now.</p>
            <p>You are locked in the carriage with others.</p>
            <p>Watching all the zombies slamming at the door, blood bursting all over, you are scared.</p>
            <p>"What on earth just happened?!!!"</p>
            <p>You try to contact your wife, but there is no service. The Internet does not work, either. There is no way to contact anyone.</p>
            <p>Shawn suggests going out and looking for help.</p>
            <p class="option"><a href="1_agree.html">You agree with Shawn.</a></p>
            <p class="option"><a href="1_shawnBack.html">Stay and wait for help</a></p>
