            <p>“Staying here is the safest choice for now! Who knows if there are more out there.” </p>
            <p>Shawn insists on going. He opens the other door and leaves. You quickly shut the door tight.</p>
            <p>After a while, you hear a loud noise coming from far away. You look over the window to check.</p>
            <p> “OMG, it’s shawn!!!” He is running for his life. Hundreds of zombies are chasing after Shawn.</p>
            <p>Shawn shouts at you, “OPEN THE DOOR!!! LET ME IN!!!”</p>
