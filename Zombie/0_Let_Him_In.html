            <p>Shawn climbs up to the window so that the zombies can not catch him. </p>
            <p>You open the window to let him in, but you soon notice that there is a scratch on his arm.</p>
            <p>You are scared that he is hurt by a zombie. </p>
            <p> Shawn explains, “I fell down and it was just a scratch.” </p>
            <p>Every one believes him for now, but you see him secretly cover his other arm as if he wants to cover something up.</p>
            <p>It still happens.</p>
            <p>Shawn goes crazy and wants to bite you.</p>
            <p>In the fight, Shawn bites you in the shoulder, but you are able to lock Shawn in a small room.</p>
            <p>You know death will come to you soon, but you still don't know if your daughter is safe.</p>
            <p>"Tracy, could you please find my daughter? Her name is Kitty. She must be scared." </p>
            <p>You take out Kitty's photo from your wallet and give it to Tracy.</p>
            <p>"Thank you." Before you lose your sanity, you kill yourself for good.</p>
